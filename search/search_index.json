The \"Fly More Combo\" retails for USD$1050 and comes with 3 batteries and a controller, so you can fly fairly consistently throughout the day straight after unboxing.</p> <p>It has some major advantages:</p> <ul> <li>It's less than 250 grams, so it's very lightly regulated in many countries;   in many places you don't need an operators licence, and often things like   flight ceilings don't apply to micro-drones.</li> <li>It has a remarkably good camera, creating imagery that rivals much more   expensive drones.</li> <li>It's surprisingly stable in the wind despite its small size.</li> <li>It's really cheap (USD$1050 for the Fly More Combo, ~$750 for the drone with   only 1 battery and basic controller) and widely available.</li> <li>It's easy to get serviced because it's a very popular consumer drone.</li> </ul> <p>However, the Mini 4 Pro has 2 main drawbacks:</p> <ol> <li>It doesn't work with most mapping mission planning software suites (because    DJI has still not released an SDK for it, despite claiming they intended to do so).</li> <li>It's not the fastest flyer, so it can't cover the amount of area that a more    expensive drone can do in a day.</li> </ol> <p>For the former drawback, we specifically developed our Drone Tasking Manager to work well with the Mini 4 Pro because it's such an effective, accessible, and affordable option for communities. As far as we know our DroneTM is the only way to use the Mini 4 Pro for serious professional mapping, but it does work, and it actually works pretty well.</p> <p>But be warned; you'd still be investing in a drone for which only our solution really permits professional mapping. Our solution is open source and free to use: no \"freemium\" licensing whereby you only get a limited functionality.</p> <p>It's a Digital Public Good and we're not trying to make money off it, we're trying to empower communities with it.</p> <p>For the latter drawback, it's really a question of who is flying. If it's a highly-paid person who travels away from home to cover a given area, you want a larger, faster drone to cover more area per day (you can cover 1-4 km\u00b2 per day at 5cm GSD with good enough overlap for decent 3D using a Mini 4 Pro, whereas you can cover &gt;20km\u00b2/day with a Sensefly Ebee or Wingtra One - but those are $20,000 instead of $1050).</p> <p>If it's local community members flying relatively close to home, it can be much more cost effective using a small fleet of cheaper drones like the Mini 4 Pro (plus it helps the local economy and people).</p>"},{"location":"about/faq/#q-what-problem-do-we-solve-with-dronetm","title":"Q.
