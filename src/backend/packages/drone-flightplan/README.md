## Overview

The Drone Flightplan Generator is a Python package designed to automate the creation of flight plans for drones. This tool is essential for users needing efficient and precise aerial surveys, mapping, and imagery collection.

### Waypoint File

DJI drones require waypoint files. WPML route files all end with a ".kmz" suffix and are essentially archive files packed in ZIP format. After decompression of a standard WPML route file, its file structure is as follows:

For more details, check the [DJI Cloud API documentation](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Cloud-API-Doc/blob/master/docs/en/60.api-reference/00.dji-wpml/10.overview.md).

## Installation

To install the package, use pip:

```bash
pip install drone-flightplan
```

## Modules

### 1. `calculate_parameters`

This module helps in calculating various parameters required for the flight plan, such as:

```
calculate_parameters(
    forward_overlap: float,
    side_overlap: float,
    agl: float,
    gsd: float = None,
    image_interval: int = 2,
)
```

**Parameters:**

- `AGL` (Altitude above ground level in meters) = 115
- `Forward overlap` = 75
- `Side overlap` = 75

**Fixed Parameters:**

- `Image interval` = 2 sec
- `Vertical FOV` = 0.99
- `Horizontal FOV` = 1.25

**Calculations:**

- Forward Photo height = AGL \_Vertical_FOV
- Side Photo width = AGL \_Horizontal_FOV
- Forward overlap distance = Forward photo height \_Forward overlap
- Side overlap distance = Side photo width \_Side overlap
- Forward spacing = Forward photo height - Forward overlap distance
- Side spacing = Side photo width - Side overlap distance
- Ground speed = Forward spacing / Image interval

**Parameters:**

- Run `uv run calcparams` to see options.

### 2. `create_waypoint`

This module generates waypoints for a given project area, using parameters such as altitude, GSD, overlap ratios, and the option to avoid no-fly zones. It can also create 3D waypoints:

```
from drone_flightplan import create_waypoint

create_waypoint(
    project_area,
    agl,
    gsd,
    forward_overlap,
    side_overlap,
    rotation_angle=0.0,
    flight_mode="waypoints",
    generate_3d=False,
    no_fly_zones=None,
    take_off_point=None,
)
```

**Parameters:**

- Run `uv run waypoints` to see options.

### 3. `add_elevation_from_dem`

This module integrates elevation data from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) into the flight plan to account for changes in terrain. This ensures more accurate waypoint positioning for varying altitudes:

```
from drone_flightplan import add_elevation_from_dem

add_elevation_from_dem(raster_file, points, outfile)
```

**Parameters:**

- Run `uv run addelev` to see options.

### 4. `create_placemarks`

This module creates placemarks for the flight plan, useful for marking key locations:

```
from drone_flightplan import create_placemarks

create_placemarks(
    waypoints_geojson: Union[str, FeatureCollection, dict],
    parameters: dict
)
```

**Parameters:**

- Run `uv run placemarks` to see options.

### 5. `create_wpml`

This module is responsible for creating WPML files (Waypoint Markup Language), which are often used for visualizing waypoints and flight paths in different tools or simulators:

```
from drone_flightplan import create_wpml

create_wpml(
    placemark_geojson: Union[str, FeatureCollection, dict],
    output_file_path: str = "/tmp/",
)
```

**Parameters:**

- `placemark_geojson`: The placemark coordinates to be included in the flight plan mission.
- `output_file_path`: The output file path for the WPML file.

### 6. `create_flightplan`

This is the core function responsible for generating a complete flight plan for a specified area of interest (AOI):

```
from drone_flightplan import create_flightplan

create_flightplan(
    aoi,
    forward_overlap,
    side_overlap,
    agl,
    gsd=None,
    image_interval=2,
    dem=None,
    outfile=None,
    flight_mode="waypoints",
    rotation_angle=0.0,
    take_off_point=None,
)
```

**Parameters:**

- Run `uv run flightplan` to see options.
